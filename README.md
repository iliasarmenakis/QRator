QRator is a tool specifically designed to prevent and counter social engineering attacks, focusing on simulating and executing Quishing attacks via QR codes. It specializes in cloning and modifying websites based on user instructions. The analyzed version adds a "pay here" button to a cloned site, aiming to manipulate users into revealing personal information (e.g., credit card details, addresses).

It has two versions:

- CLI version: Runs on Linux via a Python script in the terminal.
- Hybrid version: Website cloning occurs on a Linux system, while execution happens through a mobile app interface.

Users can choose between:

- Instant attacks: Generate a QR code for immediate use with a pocket printer.
- Planned attacks: Extract a URL from a QR code, organize the attack using the CLI version, and tailor it to their preferences.
Both attack methods share identical programming processes for cloning and modifying websites.
